# Cascade_CNN

Repository for "[A Convolutional Neural Network Cascade for Face Detection](http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2015/papers/Li_A_Convolutional_Neural_2015_CVPR_paper.pdf)", implemented with Caffe, C++ interface. The Cascade CNN provide an idea of fast way to detect the face through cascade different size of CNN.

## Result

### Face Detection 

The results of each procedure in Cascade CNNs are contained in result folder. The final results are shown in the flowing. These two pictures are collected by AFW and MegaFace separately.

### Time Cost

The time cost are compared with the value in the paper and its curve is shown in the flowing. Our result is generated by testing a 1080P live video.

 | Paper result | Our result
------------ | ------------- | -------------
CPU only | 71ms | 281.3ms (E3)
GPU | 28.6ms (Titan) | 20.9ms (1080)
